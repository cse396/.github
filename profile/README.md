## CSE396 Spring 2023 - Group 10

## Description
Welcome to our GitHub organization for Gebze Technical University's Engineering Project  course, CSE396.

## Project
The   main   goal   of   the   project   is   to   remotely   search   items   in   an   unstructured environment   via   a   multi   legged,   semi   autonomous   robotic   device   while   alsogenerating a 3D map of the environment.   
The minimum requirements of the project are:   
- Legged robotic device running on a real time capable operating system   
- Communication link between the robot and the remote control center  
- Open   source   (I   mean   linux)   desktop   environment   that   the   3D recontructed environment can be displayed.
